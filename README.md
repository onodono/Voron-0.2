|[Bento Mini](https://www.printables.com/model/517219-bento-mini-for-bambu-lab-x1c-p1p-and-voron-v02) using a GDSTIME 6028 blower fan. This has positively reduced the odour when printing ASA. Mounted using [Split Low Profile Mounts](https://www.printables.com/model/687907-split-low-profile-mount-for-bento-mini). Used the remix that split the backing to allow it be printed on the V0.| 10.14 |

|Functional Mods|
|-|
|[FZ Extruder](https://github.com/FZaii/FZ-Extruder/tree/main) - I like how the latching system makes manual filament load and unload very easy. But now I forget to close the latch sometimes...|
|[Dragon Burner V8](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner)|
|[Side Panels](https://www.printables.com/model/1094180-voron-0-side-panels) - In theory, this reduces the volume of air that needs to be heated inside the chamber of the V0, reducing the amount of time needed to reach max temp.|
|[Magnetic Backplate](https://www.printables.com/model/659559-magnetic-backplate-for-voron-v02) - Cools the MCU and host board to prevent shutdown when printing at high temp. The magnetic attachment makes removal very accessible.|
[Foldable Spool Holder with springload](https://www.printables.com/model/586376-foldable-spool-holder-for-voron-02-with-spring)|
|[Z-Cover for Kirigami bed](https://www.printables.com/model/1043218-voron-v02-z-cover-for-kirigami-mode-esay-installat) - Stops scraps of filament from falling below the deck.|
|[Lazy Cam - Tool Free Locking Idlers](https://www.printables.com/model/533483-voron-02-lazycams-tool-free-locking-idlers-models-)|
|[PEI Positioning Jig](https://www.printables.com/model/744773-voron-v02-pei-sheet-positioning-jig) - Makes aligning the PEI sheet easy. I used superglue to permanently attach the pieces to the metal bed.|
|[Tophat Sealing Blocks](https://www.printables.com/model/728972-voron-v02-tophat-1515-sealing-block) - In theory, it reduces the amount of hot air that can escape the chamber. I'm currently testing my own remix that also mounts the Matchstick LEDs.|
|[Upper Rear Bowden Inlet with split](https://www.printables.com/model/955328-v0-upper-rear-bowden-inlet-urbi-for-voron-v0-split) - Makes filament load/unload a breeze. The split design means it can be printed on the V0 and superglued together|
|[Thicker Thumb Screws](https://www.printables.com/model/456042-voron-v0-thicker-thumb-nuts) - Easier bed-levelling.|


|Aesthetic Mods|
